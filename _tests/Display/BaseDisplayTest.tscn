text_slides = [ "1. We have big plans for how you can use this space. It’s going to fill in and bustle with activity like a real growing town. It will be true to the nature of the moon, and to the real prospects we have for building there.", "2. In Neighborhood zones, pick a place you would like to put a home, and reserve that plot. Use the builder app to design and make your home. Put it in your space. Once it’s in the system, you will be able to use it, and place things inside it. ", "3. Very creative designs are possible for your home. The gravity is low, the surroundings are already a controlled environment, fabrication is automated, and assembly is by robot. The example neighborhood provides some inspiration. Dive in to the possibilities.", "4. As more homes are built, you will acquire neighbors. Together you can design and build the shared facilities each neighborhood has. Those designs can be changed at any time – to set up for an event, showcase things you’ve made, or just for fun.", "5. Low gravity is the thing that injects the most fun into lunar life. Once player controls are complete, you will be able to explore that. It’ll be lunar parkour. Learn to jump, swing, and climb to move about, making use of any structure to do so. ", "6. The possibilities will be grounded in reality. You’ll need to learn how to roll on landing so you can make giant leaps safely. And how to slow down, and turn – that’s tricky on the moon. If your player gets hurt, don’t worry. A robot will play paramedic. ", "7. There is even a swimming pool where you can play with a whole other facet of lunar mobility. See how high you can leap from the water. Work out acrobatic dives from the diving board. Or just belly flop to see how huge the splash is.", "8. Simple games like races or tag will be easy to set up. Just pick the rules, set timers, finish lines, scoreboards and such, if you want, with tools in the game, and start playing. It’s a small and natural extension of the capabilities Moon Town will already have.", "9. Some of the entities in Moon Town will be AI - all the drones, androids, and other robots, and some of the people. Characters can be created here and programmed in lots of ways. Some illustrate how the town works, some portray the lives of residents.", "10. Following and interacting with them reveals those stories. You can also create more, by making new AIs. There will be an app that provides everything needed. Your creations will be added to Moon Town.   The possibilities are rich indeed.", "11. You can make an AI that provides a moment of fun, or one that tells a complex story, even including a web of other AIs, even that continues on for years.  You can use them to explain things. Or to liven up an event. Or create mini-games. Lots of things.", "12. Camera apps will allow you to film your AIs, as well as real players, to create videos or graphic novels.  You will be able to add props to the Moonwards library for use in them. It will be an easy and flexible way to tell stories, and export them to other platforms.", "13. For advanced users and people in the space business, complex models can be displayed here. There will be ways to add a slide show like this, tool tips, animations, or code modules for custom interactivity. Center Atrium was designed for such displays. ", "14. Advanced users will have the option of adding models and code only to the game, not the library. That way, their work can’t be copied or used by other players, creating flexibility to showcase stuff without sacrificing control over use.", "15. Anything in the library is free to be used in any way. ", "16. One day the moon will be something like this. Everything here is a feasible, sensible design. Exploring here can help us take firmer steps towards that future." ]
