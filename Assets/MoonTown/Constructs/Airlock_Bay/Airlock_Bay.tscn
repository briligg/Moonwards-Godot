People\'s homes are fabricated outside and brought in through here, usually in one piece. The lower floor of the Airlock Bay is mostly used by robots handling traffic of this kind.

bbtext_fields = PoolStringArray( "Ok, this spacesuit is different from anything you\'ve seen before. Hard-body spacesuits with metal ring joints allow good mobility and a capacity to hold a high pressure atmosphere inside a suit. That\'s what has been done with most of the Artemis spacesuit. It allows the wearer to avoid hours of breathing pure oxygen before suiting up and going outside, which is necessary with today\'s suits to avoid \'the bends\' - tiny nitrogen bubbles in the blood that are really painful and possibly deadly. This design is all hard body. (Including the legs, but you can\'t see that because they are protected by a rubber and fabric sleeve against particles entering the joints - and the exoskeleton powered assistance) Making the whole top half one single piece is done because no matter what you do with hard body pieces, hands are a problem. And also there are a few unpleasant things about using a spacesuit. ", "The pressure in a spacesuit makes bending your fingers a lot more difficult. In current spacesuits your hands get tired after a while. Supposing that can be overcome with exoskeleton assistance, you still are wearing thick gloves. Designing to avoid that isn\'t possible even by Moon Town\'s time. Having a helmet on also imposes a lot of restrictions. Sure, today\'s spacesuits have tricks so you can scratch your nose with a stick and a piece of velcro, and later Apollo spacesuits even had food sticks available from a little holder the astronauts could reach with their mouths. Let\'s consider the advantages of this alternative.", "You have two robotic arms that you move and use by having the position of gloves on your hands read and multiplied to apply to the larger scale of the exterior arms. This gives you longer reach, greater strength, and greater agility. The gloves use haptic feedback to allow you to feel texture on what the robot hands touch, much more than you\'d get through the thickness of a regular spacesuit glove. You can stretch your arms, scratch anything but your legs, eat a sandwich. The clear canopy does double duty as a high resolution viewscreen. With that and your hands free you can do much more complex computer work than if you were using a helmet screen and controls integrated into spacesuit gloves. Have the robot hands hold up a rock sample where you can see it, while you review the tests done on it and send a report to Earth, for instance. The capsule half and the legs each come in 3 sizes. By combining the best sizes the fit is comfortable for 99% of people.", "The suit has a parasol, like the androids have. The shade provided extends the time you can be in the sun by maybe 30%. If some accident knocks you over, and the suit has lost power, as a last ditch you can use the little stick arms to roll and get to your feet yourself. Then if necessary you can disengage the exoskeleton legs and walk back to an airlock yourself. That last point is, in fact, why this whole thing isn\'t a slender capsule with robotic limbs - but also there is something nice about walking yourself, though it be assisted by an exoskeleton (which also means you can walk very quickly)." )

Rather than go outside yourself, which takes a lot longer and is more cumbersome, people often choose to experience the surface virtually through an android. They will even sometimes do this to quickly get something done in another, distant habitat. In this case, the interface is simple, just a headset that shows you what the android sees and hears (which only includes vibrations due to contact if it is outside). The kiosk reads the position of your body and has the android simulate your movements. Small, stylized leg movements are interpreted as walking, running, or jumping. Various voice commands are used for extra functions - zooming vision, infrared vision, autopilot to a named destination, things like that.", "On the top floor of this hab is an example of the full-body version of an android interface, you can find out more about that there. This station will allow you to take control of an android at one of several locations, some of which are far away and could take 10 or 15 minutes to reach if it was necessary to get a vehicle first and then drive there. As the town matures there will be stations for controlling androids scattered all over it, and individuals could have their own portable interface for their own personal android. Androids will return to their depot after a while if unused. If you tap into one before that time you will \'appear\' in an odd spot, because the person before you left the android wherever they were using it." )

They rarely fall, posessing superhuman precision, agility, and sensory acuity. They can run at a clip of about 50 km/h but rarely do so indoors for safety reasons.", "The clear faceplate on their heads is a viewscreen that normally projects the face of the operator onto the screen. The little gold cylinder sticking out the top of their heads is a neatly folded parasol using an origami design so that a large disk shaped parasol can be stored easily in a small space. Because of the intensity of the sun and the difficulty of shedding heat in a vacuum, the parasol is an important tool allowing the android to keep itself mostly in the shade as it goes about outside in the daytime. The cylinder on its back is for similar purposes - it is an icepack that its internal coolant loops all lead to. It can be swapped out quickly at any of many stations or depots for a fresh one. The android\'s body is stuffed with batteries. They are shaped to fit in any space not taken up by motors, actuators, sensors, processors, or artificial muscles. It is able to do a lot of work before needing to recharge, completing what a human would regard as a work shift on a single charge almost always.
