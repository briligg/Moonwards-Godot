Surface textures can be created by pressing stamps into the material while still soft. It\'s a very versatile and cheap option, strong enough for furniture and even dwellings. ", "The yellow supports are made of iron bar that\'s been bent into shapes. It\'s a little more expensive, not much. Both the bars and the panel stuff have had enamels baked onto their surfaces to create their colors and finishes - highly durable surface treatments. The two levels of the kiosk, the round shapes, are of glass cast and shaped in the glass factory. Those are the most expensive pieces, as the glass factory spends most of its time making things for export into space or for creating new habitats for the town. In their case, the coloring agents are part of the glass itself. The kiosk is built around one of the cables that support all the main interior floors.

Short fibers were created in a process loosely similar to how cotton candy is made, and formed into mats.  The cloth and mats were used in the creation of composite materials with sufficient stength under all anticipated forces - tension, compression, shear, and vibration - to ensure a safe environment for at least a century. Joining was done with molten regolith, or occasionally with molten metals. The processes for this were simple enough that what the materials lacked in strength could be compensated for in quantity, and still be the economical option.", "Once all structures were complete, the roofs of the gallery habitats (like this one) were covered with 6 meters of packed regolith. The outer surface of that cover layer was sintered together by gently baking it with microwaves. The inner facades were coated with a variety of locally made enamels, or sprayed molten aluminum, to create an air-tight volume. Conduits were placed inside to carry all pipes and wires. All the main infrastructure was then set up - heat exchangers, water pumps and tanks, fans, filters, air tanks, compressors, sensors, telecoms, computers, fiberoptic cables distributing sunlight collected outside. Only after all that was done were the airlocks installed and the habs pressurized with air." )

bbtext_fields = PoolStringArray( "Here\'s one of the things that makes moving on the moon so hard to get used to - gravity is a sixth of what you\'ve always known, but inertia is the same. If you move on a slant like Earth stairs, you\'ll be tempted to take them with all the speed you find so easy here, and that would often lead to falls as it\'s so easy to miscalculate the force and posture needed to brake forward motion. Stairs here are always a lot steeper than Earth stairs, both to mostly eliminate the horizontal component of Earth stair climbing so that speeding is less hazardous, and to save space. Maximizing friction is also a good idea as there is so much less of it at your disposal. Near vertical vectors win here too.", "These stairs are the maximum example of this design principle. Steps are spaced more than 50 cm apart. In this gravity, the force needed to climb one such step is half what is needed to climb the average step on Earth. The gap you need to span with your feet is a bit long for those of us who are short without a bit of a hop, but such hops are quite easy. In fact, most people would tend to take these steps two or three at a time once they were used to the motion. The center pole takes the place of a handrail, though with six times as long to compensate before you\'ve lost your balance, it\'s not used much by veterans. But it\'s useful for sliding down instead of bothering to use the steps. Or for bracing against with your back if you are carrying something big or heavy. Or if you need to switch to a sort of clambering mode because you are injured or sick. Other harder, but plausible options - pulling yourself up the pole, including with your hands alone, and simply letting yourself drop from the floor above and rolling when you land. Careful with that last one, but it\'s entirely doable." )

It takes a lot of light for that to work, but it\'s important. First, these plants help filter the air, sop up excess humidity, and are a stop-gap system to absorb carbon dioxide for a while even if all the air purification systems are down. Second, they damp echoes. That\'s important in an environment composed of stone, metal, and glass. Honorable mention - you\'ve left behind all the world\'s flora and fauna except for the minimal assortment that can be made to grow here. You\'ve left behind the sky, the clouds, the wind. So all the sense of nature that is humanly possible has been created here. This greenery, and the sun that is piped in through the roof, are combined to create a sense of light much like that of sun filtering through the trees of a forest. It doesn\'t work too well yet, but it will get better.", "So, about that sun. Bringing in sun without bringing in radiation can only be done by using the things you see out the window, the poles with the disks on them. The disks are parabolic mirrors that focus sun on a secondary mirror, which then passes the light to an inlet to a quartz fiber optic cable. That cable enters the hab and the sun spills out it, to the human eye identical to the way it entered it. Because it\'s delivered by cable, it can be distributed however is most convenient.                                                                                                              These apparatuses are known as light tubes. Each one delivers all the sun that falls on a mirror 15 meters across. The mirror turns to track the sun all day, so the amount it delivers is always the maximum. And sunshine on the moon is about 30% stronger than the sun that filters through Earth\'s atmosphere. To create an artificial night, the mirrors turn off axis for 12 hours of every 24 during the lunar day. Here we aren\'t far below the lip of the crater, so the sun shines in this way for almost 15 days, and then it\'s night for another 15. Further down in these gallery habitats, the sun only lasts about 11 days, then 19 days of night. ", "They work at night though, too. In order to reduce the heat burden that has to be pumped out of the habs each day, and to continuously use the careful, complex lighting arrangement set up through the fiber optics, over the lunar night LED bulbs lining the blue box on each light tube are turned on. Their light is piped down the arm at the top, which swings around to cover the inlet. Their waste heat stays outside.                                                                                                                                There are hundreds of light tubes on the roofs of the galleries. The quartz fiber-optics their light is funneled through is of exquisite quality, allowing them to be threaded all the way down to bring patches of sun even to the bottom floors of these habs, without the cables heating up. The heat that comes with that light does soak into the habs, though. There is an info button farther down in the hab on one of the heat exchangers that talks about how that is handled - those are the things with the giant yellowish tubes on top." )

It\'s a carousel designed to spin at a speed that pushes people on its outer rim against the wall with a force equal to Earth gravity. In that case, the wall is used as a floor. It is angled so that the outward force due to being spun and the downward force of lunar gravity together have the net effect that you can stand on that surface as though it was quite level. You might call it the spin floor, as it\'s the surface people use to move around when the carousel is spun up.", "Every person in this neighborhood spends a few hours here every day. It can carry all of them at the same time, though that\'s a little crowded. How much time would actually need to be spent in artificial gravity by a long-term lunar resident will not be known until quite extensive testing has been done, hopefully in a space station in Earth orbit, well before anyone goes to the moon with the intention of living there. The uneducated guess here is that it takes about 3 hours a day to stay healthy, for the average person. People usually do it whenever fits best in their day, sometimes in two or three separate sessions. So the carousel is spinning most of the time, with usually less than 15 people on it together. It stops every 3 hours to let people on and off, but once accustomed to its motion, most people can get on or off while its moving.", "Exercise is an essential activity done while on the carousel. Jumping around a lot is unpopular though. Carousels are only 16 meters in radius; when standing, your head is experiencing a tenth less centrifugal force than your feet are. Moving around also involves changes in the forces on you that are quite discernible. Even old hands have trouble not feeling nauseous if they move too vigorously. Slow movements are the way to go - yoga, free weights, tai chi, stuff like that. Aside from exercising, people hang out or do desk work." )

Powder regolith is packed in the space between them, and in fact all around the whole structure in a space between the shell and the faces of the trench. The glass and stone materials the outer shell of the hab is made of can stand a lot of vibration, but not much shaking. Any cracking would lead to loss of air, and accumulated cracks could make that air loss expensive. At the same time, small cracks are hard to find. Repairing such cracks is simple, but you have to find them first. Isolating the hab from the shaking of moonquakes was deemed the better approach.", "We have very limited data on moonquakes, just what was recorded for a few years by a few seismometers set up by the Apollo astronauts. Those spotted many small moonquakes every lunar month, they are of no consequence. Up to a few times a year, there were shallow moonquakes that occur within about 30 km of the surface. The strongest of those was magnitude 5.1. A good estimate is that a hab placed at random on the moon \'can expect a shallow moonquake of body wave magnitude greater than 4.5 within a range of 100 km about once in 400 years\' (from Benaroya, Building Habitats on the Moon). As these habs were designed to last centuries, adequate protection was important." )

That coolant is pumped around and returns to this box, which is full of equipment that transfers the heat in that coolant to the coolant in a separate circuit, which runs down the borehole underneath this structure and then out to a trench beside it. Those boreholes also contain the cables that anchor to their walls, and connect at the top to the cables within the columns that meet behind each of these heat pump structures. The column cables are holding down the roof and helping stabilize the walls of the habitat, counteracting the outward pressure of the air. The boreholes descend 100 m into the ground.", "Here near the top of the hab, the ground is made mostly of dirt, with some rocks mixed in. The dirt here is highly insulating, heat moves through it extremely badly. The boreholes are large enough that smaller branch boreholes can be drilled out of them to the sides. Some were created to increase the anchoring capacity of the boreholes. To make cooling effective this close to the rim of the crater, one branch of each borehole had to be routed to trenches extending away from the exterior of the hab. Each one of these upper heat pumps has one, containing a radiator, and underneath it, a heavy slab of slag. The trenches are uncovered whenever sunlight doesn\'t reach the radiator, which thanks to the walls of the trench means for 25 days of every 30. For the 5 days it does, the heat being shed from the hab is directed into the slab. For the rest of the time, the radiator radiates it into space.", "As you move down through the gallery habs, ever more of the surrounding ground is composed of buried boulders. If one can judge by the topology of the crater, true bedrock is just under the surface starting about a kilometer and a half below the altitude of the rim. Though heat doesn\'t move through rock very fast, being thermally connected to the very bedrock of the moon\'s crust bridges the habs to a nearly inexhaustible heat sink that\'s -20 degrees Celsius. So, in the lower reaches of the galleries, these heat pumps connect to a conduit running to several points where it was feasible to sink boreholes all the way to the bedrock. Once enough such boreholes were created, conduits were laid back up to the rim, to the atrium habs and Teacup hab, to supplement their existing radiator systems." )
