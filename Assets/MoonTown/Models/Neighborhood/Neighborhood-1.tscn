There are 26 homes in this cluster. That is about the number of homes that would accommodate 40 to 50 residents, between couples and singles. The facilities shared by neighborhoods are designed to serve that number of people well, and become increasingly inadequate if shared among more. Urban planning in this town calls for neighborhoods to house no more than 50 permanent residents. These homes at this point are just sketched in. Their detail will increase with time. Only one, the orange one on the far right of the ground level, has some furnishings and such - though it\'s missing structural details.", "Children remain an impossibility on the moon at the time of this portrayal. The effect of lunar gravity on a growing body is really unclear. It will be a long road to determining what the health risks are, and that\'s even before figuring out how to protect the health of growing children. Pregnancy\? Way more to figure out there - everything points to many serious risks. Children below the age of 18 are not permitted on the moon. Every precaution is taken to ensure that pregnancy does not occur. Thus, dwellings are for one or two people." )
