There are 26 homes in this cluster. That is about the number of homes that would accommodate 40 to 50 residents, between couples and singles. The facilities shared by neighborhoods are designed to serve that number of people well, and become increasingly inadequate if shared among more. Urban planning in this town calls for neighborhoods to house no more than 50 permanent residents. These homes at this point are just sketched in. Their detail will increase with time. Only one, the orange one on the far right of the ground level, has some furnishings and such - though it\'s missing structural details.", "Children remain an impossibility on the moon at the time of this portrayal. The effect of lunar gravity on a growing body is really unclear. It will be a long road to determining what the health risks are, and that\'s even before figuring out how to protect the health of growing children. Pregnancy\? Way more to figure out there - everything points to many serious risks. Children below the age of 18 are not permitted to live on the moon. Children below 13 can\'t visit even briefly. Every precaution is taken to ensure that pregnancy does not occur. Thus, dwellings are for one or two people.", "The maximum volume a home may have is 60 m3. There are several common dimensional choices to meet that - 3 x 4 x 5 meters is popular, as is 3 x 8 x 2.5, and 4 x 6 x 2.5. (Those measurements are roughly the same in yards.) This is roomy enough because a number of facilities found in Earth homes are instead shared, to ensure the quality and quantity of two vital, limited resources: air, and space. Humidity and odors are really hard to control if everyone is cooking, showering, and doing laundry in their own homes. If a resident is willing to put in the large and noisy equipment required to dehumidify and filter all the air of their kitchenette and personal shower to lunar standards, then fine. But the volume restriction on homes discourages this because only consistent proper use makes that equipment effective, and besides, space with life support is very limited.", "People here spend 98% of their time inside the habitats, and can never truly go outside like we can, unprotected. The volume within the habs has to be an adequate substitute for the outdoors on Earth. Shared space is maximized for as spacious an environment as possible. Such space can easily be reconfigured to serve any purpose - basketball court one day, meeting hall the next. Each cubic meter of shared space is far more useful, and far more pleasant. Variety is the spice of life. One really comes to appreciate that on the moon. On top of this, shared neighborhood facilities are completely optimized for use by Moon Town\'s sophisticated robots. If it wasn\'t for them, sharing like this would be far harder to make work. They make life easy. They do many duties important to smooth and pleasant living in Moon Town, far better than humans could, and they also make you breakfast in bed and sew buttons on your shirts." )

bbtext_fields = PoolStringArray( "Like most large internal structures in the habitats, the main floors of this hab are supported largely by cables descending from the roof. It\'s the most efficient engineering approach in terms of materials needed and space used. The cables also reinforce the hab roofs, since the net force on them is up due to the air pressure and low gravity. The main suspension cables are generally between 8 and 15 meters apart. Houses and other structures often connect to nearby cables so that some proportion of their weight is suspended by them. It reduces the amount of material needed to make a dwelling structurally sound. Since packages for house construction have a mass budget, this is a way to stretch that budget. The tactic is especially useful if you want your home to practically float in mid-air, as many of the ones here do. That\'s why on floors with direct access to the ceiling, and sometimes ones with only one floor between them and the ceiling, people planning homes sometimes get together and arrange the installment of a new cable, a smaller one just for their homes. That way by leaning a bit on each other, and also hanging from their cable, they can stack their dwellings up in a way that looks very precarious but is actually quite stable. " )

bbtext_fields = PoolStringArray( "Building these dwellings is kind of like building a dream treehouse - if you were building it in a really cool mall, and everything was super high tech. There is no need to think about weather, utilities are provided, and things that are hard to build are handled elsewhere and you don\'t need them (though you can install mini versions if you want). Not only that, the gravity is quite low and the materials used for this are pretty strong. So within the little volume that\'s yours, you can get pretty wild and free.", "This house leans out over the edge of this floor, just a little. Homes aren\'t allowed to block the light or the view of lower floors, so extending out from a floor in any other way is prohibited. Having this little lean makes the views a bit more spectacular. Sometimes people use outward leaning walls to lean against themselves. The moon\'s gravity makes leaning against a wall while standing a pretty comfortable position a person can hold for a long time. ", "To the left, you can peek a little into the utility space where this home\'s tanks for fresh water and grey water are housed. There is exterior access so they can quickly be switched out by a robot. That\'s how water in homes is handled, instead of having distribution through pipes. It reduces and simplifies the plumbing needed, and the robots that do that are a standard part of each neighborhood\'s equipment. It also assures any water contamination that is problematic is identified before that water arrives at a more central supply. Details on the handling of water supplies is talked about in the info button on the water tanks on the wall near the tree." )

The way the walls of homes are printed permits these kinds of complex shapes without difficulty. Glass objects are all made by automated equipment, so cutting out these kinds of window shapes is also not expensive. As far as privacy goes, these windows have transparent screens behind them that can change color or display images. The owner just switches that on when desire", "This home is built on a wall. That is an option many people choose. Neighborhood bounds are defined as the edges of a volume, anything within that volume is a possible plot for a home. The main thing to keep in mind is that you have to come to an agreement with your neighbors. If they find the location and design of your home objectionable, they can veto it. Usually members of a neighborhood together define the space that is for common use, and will allow home construction anywhere outside that as long as it doesn\'t block someone\'s view or access.", "Climbing 6 floors to reach your home is roughly like climbing one floor to reach it on Earth. To get a great view and more separation from neighbors, a lot of people find it worth it to ascend 10 or 20 meters to reach their front door. Having things delivered by robot is normal, and the ones that do that can handle any kind of staire. There is little inconvenience involved in living high up. Lunar residents tend to get used to heights. They don\'t think much aboout a 20 or 30 meter drop. " )
