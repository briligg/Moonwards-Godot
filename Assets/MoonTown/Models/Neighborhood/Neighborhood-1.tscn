There are 26 homes in this cluster. That is about the number of homes that would accommodate 40 to 50 residents, between couples and singles. The facilities shared by neighborhoods are designed to serve that number of people well, and become increasingly inadequate if shared among more. Urban planning in this town calls for neighborhoods to house no more than 50 permanent residents. These homes at this point are just sketched in. Their detail will increase with time. Only one, the orange one on the far right of the ground level, has some furnishings and such - though it\'s missing structural details.", "Children remain an impossibility on the moon at the time of this portrayal. The effect of lunar gravity on a growing body is really unclear. It will be a long road to determining what the health risks are, and that\'s even before figuring out how to protect the health of growing children. Pregnancy\? Way more to figure out there - everything points to many serious risks. Children below the age of 18 are not permitted to live on the moon. Children below 13 can\'t visit even briefly. Every precaution is taken to ensure that pregnancy does not occur. Thus, dwellings are for one or two people.", "The maximum volume a home may have is 60 m3. There are several common dimensional choices to meet that - 3 x 4 x 5 meters is popular, as is 3 x 8 x 2.5, and 4 x 6 x 2.5. (Those measurements are roughly the same in yards.) This is roomy enough because a number of facilities found in Earth homes are instead shared, to ensure the quality and quantity of two vital, limited resources: air, and space. Humidity and odors are really hard to control if everyone is cooking, showering, and doing laundry in their own homes. If a resident is willing to put in the large and noisy equipment required to dehumidify and filter all the air of their kitchenette and personal shower to lunar standards, then fine. But the volume restriction on homes discourages this because only consistent proper use makes that equipment effective, and besides, space with life support is very limited.", "People here spend 98% of their time inside the habitats, and can never truly go outside like we can, unprotected. The volume within the habs has to be an adequate substitute for the outdoors on Earth. Shared space is maximized for as spacious an environment as possible. Such space can easily be reconfigured to serve any purpose - basketball court one day, meeting hall the next. Each cubic meter of shared space is far more useful, and far more pleasant. Variety is the spice of life. One really comes to appreciate that on the moon. On top of this, shared neighborhood facilities are completely optimized for use by Moon Town\'s sophisticated robots. If it wasn\'t for them, sharing like this would be far harder to make work. They make life easy. They do many duties important to smooth and pleasant living in Moon Town, far better than humans could, and they also make you breakfast in bed and sew buttons on your shirts." )

bbtext_fields = PoolStringArray( "Like most large internal structures in the habitats, the main floors of this hab are supported largely by cables descending from the roof. It\'s the most efficient engineering approach in terms of materials needed and space used. The cables also reinforce the hab roofs, since the net force on them is up due to the air pressure and low gravity. The main suspension cables are generally between 8 and 15 meters apart. Houses and other structures often connect to nearby cables so that some proportion of their weight is suspended by them. It reduces the amount of material needed to make a dwelling structurally sound. Since packages for house construction have a mass budget, this is a way to stretch that budget. The tactic is especially useful if you want your home to practically float in mid-air, as many of the ones here do. That\'s why on floors with direct access to the ceiling, and sometimes ones with only one floor between them and the ceiling, people planning homes sometimes get together and arrange the installment of a new cable, a smaller one just for their homes. That way by leaning a bit on each other, and also hanging from their cable, they can stack their dwellings up in a way that looks very precarious but is actually quite stable. " )

Homes aren\'t allowed to block the light or the view of lower floors, so extending out from a floor in any other way is prohibited. Having this little lean makes the views a bit more spectacular. Sometimes people use outward leaning walls to lean against themselves. The moon\'s gravity makes leaning against a wall while standing a pretty comfortable position a person can hold for a long time.

First, remember that having to lift or lower things, or reach them in a high place, is a trivial task. Furniture that folds away or is hung on a wall when not in use is common. Second, remember how much easier movements and positions are for your body. Changing position between standing, sitting, and lying down is little effort, and just a minimal layer of padding is enough to make a surface comfortable as a cushion or bed. Having to crouch or bend over is also not a big deal. Third, consider how much stronger materials are in these conditions. Many dimensions of furnishings and structures can be thinner and still do the job.", "Augmenting these advantages further is the plentiful supply of power and locally manufactured electromechanical devices, both of which are cheap. People often choose to incorporate furniture and structures into their homes that move or fold at the press of a button. This is generally done with large items, like beds, patios, and sometimes entire floors. People also sometimes create partial floors that are only a meter or so high, most commonly for use as a cubbyhole type of space, or for extensive storage needs." )

That is an option many people choose. Neighborhood bounds are defined as the edges of a volume, anything within that volume is a possible plot for a home. The main thing to keep in mind is that you have to come to an agreement with your neighbors. If they find the location and design of your home objectionable, they can veto it. Usually members of a neighborhood together define the space that is for common use, and will allow home construction anywhere outside that as long as it doesn\'t block someone\'s view or access.", "Climbing 6 floors to reach your home is roughly like climbing one floor to reach it on Earth. To get a great view and more separation from neighbors, a lot of people find it worth it to ascend 10 or 20 meters to reach their front door. Having things delivered by robot is normal, and the ones that do that can handle any kind of staire. There is little inconvenience involved in living high up.

They fit neatly into sleeves of insulation. The insulation used is vacuum-core, a lunar product that encases a layer of hard vacuum between layers of special reflective glass. To prep for use, the box and sleeve are taken outside just after sunset. The box is removed from its sleeve and set out on the open surface to freeze overnight. Many such boxes are set out at that time. Before sunrise all the boxes are placed in their sleeves and stored in a simple covered trench where the heat of day doesn\'t reach at all.", "Dwellings often have custom iceboxes tailored to their particular house design, in which case they have two, one that lasts through the lunar day, and another that lasts through the night.

The price of having all this in your own home is the giant black air filtration system hanging above you. Moon Town takes air quality very seriously. If odors aren\'t captured and filtered out at the source, it can take hours before they are no longer noticeable. If all homes were creating cooking odors, smells would hang in the air all the time, despite the hefty advanced air filters that are part of each neighborhood\'s shared facilities.", "Most homes do have a cooler, a small microwave, and a cupboard with a few dishes and implements. It\'s nice to not have to go to the kitchen or wait for robot service every time you want some tea or a snack. A home with a fridge this spacious and advanced is one that gets a lot of goodies delivered from Earth, probably including expensive rarities. The sides and the clear glass of the drawers is vacuum-core insulation, one of the moon\'s specialty products. Though creating the vacuum layer in the middle of each panel is easy on the moon, it isn\'t so easy to craft the reinforced dimpled glass layers on either side of the vacuum. They have to be able to handle the air pressure of the habs, and bumps and falls and such, without the seal protecting the vacuum leaking even a little. If even a tiny amount of air filtered in, it would be enough to eliminate the insulating effect of the vacuum completely." )
